Hi, I'm Noah.

<img class="alignright" title="me_skaband" src="{{site.baseurl}}images/me_skaband.jpg" alt="Me" width="150" height="233">
I am a recent graduate of the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/) [School of Information](http://si.umich.edu/) in <a  href="http://www.si.umich.edu/msi/hci.htm">Human–Computer Interaction</a>. In the fall, I’ll begin working toward my Ph.D. in <a  href="http://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a>’s <a  href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior</a> program.

My interests range from traditional HCI; that is, creating usable, enjoyable interfaces through research and design, to ubiquitous, pervasive, and urban computing, to the sociological impacts of technologically-mediated communication in all its forms.

Current interests include emergent social norms in mediated contexts as well as how those new normative behaviors affect offline behavior in social contexts.

Broadly speaking, I am looking to do work on how networked/&#8203;pervasive/&#8203;public/&#8203;personal/&#8203;handheld computing and communication impacts behavior within and outside those systems, both individually and collectively.

My undergraduate work was in <a  title="U of M EECS" href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/">electrical engineering</a> (signal processing and communications systems), also at the University of Michigan. So I’ve been transitioning from the purely technical, through technology at the individual level (traditional HCI/cognitive psychology), to technology at the cultural and societal levels, which is a lot of fun.

I practice <a  href="http://centerforyoga.net/">Vinyasa yoga</a> as often as possible, I play the alto saxophone (formerly in the <a  href="http://mmb.music.umich.edu/">Michigan Marching Band</a>), I sing, I enjoy doing live audio, and I can usually be seen interacting with one or more Apple products.
